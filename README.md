Fantasy Cricket
A fantasy cricket match is based on batting and bowling orders, which are the most debated part of cricketing strategy. A small change in the order can change the course of the game. The concept involves selecting a team of 11 players and 3 substitutes from the pool of players who play the match. There are no budget caps and player selection is not limited to a particular number of batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders. Although in some fantasy applications, you can only create a team according to their prerequisite patterns. An example of their given pattern could be 5 batsmen, 1 wicket-keeper, 2 all-rounders, and 3 bowlers. A fantasy team can have any type of players. The main aim in a fantasy cricket match is to outscore the opposition by as large of a margin as possible.

This is the project I undertook while doing an internship in Python programming at Internshala and earned a certificate of excellence.
