Fantasy Cricket
https://youtu.be/1RhFOzJWikk?si=CYIHqxjGl9eQzzxb
A fantasy cricket match is based on batting and bowling orders, which are the
most debated part of cricketing strategy. A small change in the order can
change the course of the game. The concept involves selecting a team of 11
players and 3 substitutes from the pool of players who play the match. There
are no budget caps and player selection is not limited to a particular number
of batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders although in some fantasy applications
you can only create team according to their prerequisite patterns. An example
of their given pattern could be 5 batsmen, 1 wicket-keeper, 2 all-rounders, 3
bowlers. A fantasy team can have any type of players. The main aim in a
fantasy cricket match is to outscore the opposition by as large of a margin as
possible.
